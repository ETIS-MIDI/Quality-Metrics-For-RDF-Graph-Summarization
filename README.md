# Quality-Metrics-For-RDF-Graph-Summarization

This is the implementation of our Quality Framework that takes as input the results of any RDF Graph Summarization algorithm and the ideal summary and computes the different metrics that are required to capture the quality of the results at the different levels (schema and instance). It outputs the values for the different metrics in an automated fashion and allows computing F-measures where applicable.
